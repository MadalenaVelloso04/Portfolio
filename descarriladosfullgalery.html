        <h2 class="animated">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="animated">
            Descarrilados, meaning "derailed," is a fantasy grounded in historical reality—a story for us, 
            but a lived experience for those who endured these dark times. 
            The piece reflects on the decades in which Portugal was subjected to the oppressive dictatorship 
            of António de Oliveira Salazar, under which freedom of speech and action were stifled.
            This animation serves as both an illustrative and educational work, aiming 
            to capture the absurdity and suffocating nature of such repression through a fantastical lens. 
            In this short film, we sought to convey the weight of these restrictions and the absurdity of 
            life under authoritarian rule, creating a narrative that is impactful and accessible to new generations.

    <h2 class="animated">Concept and Creation of the bag</h2>
    <div class="featured-content animated">
        <p>
            We created a functional, portable bag for a working station, featuring three removable drawers, 
            each designed for different storage needs, such as compartments for spices. 
            To bring this concept to life, we built a high-fidelity prototype at a 1:2 scale,
             utilizing laser-cut MDF and cardboard for the structure. For a smooth curve at the corners, 
             we applied a custom cutting pattern to bend the wood effectively. 
             The fabric was decorated with a custom design using the silk-screen technique, and the entire bag received a 
             hand-painted finish with acrylics, adding a unique, artisanal touch. This station is both practical and portable, 
             allowing chefs to carry essential tools and ingredients with ease, and it captures the distinctive aesthetic 
             of the Jóia de África brand.

        Mon Oncle has a gentle humor and charm that I wanted to preserve by using fresh, inviting hues. 
        This brightness complements the character's whimsical defiance of modernity, which feels optimistic 
        rather than cynical. Through these posters, I hoped to honor Jacques Tati's iconic style—his ability 
        to criticize without losing humor, to dissect routine without stripping it of joy—by blending color, 
        minimalism, and texture in homage to Hulot's enduring charm.

            This project, in partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation, 
            aimed to bolster small business growth through strategic rebranding and improved market visibility. 
            Our team collaborated with Jóia de África, a lively African restaurant based in Lisbon, 
            to enhance its brand identity and expand its business reach. We developed an in-depth brand book outlining 
            cohesive guidelines—from logos and color schemes to typography and visual style. 
            The rebranding sought to capture the authentic essence of Jóia de África, a space celebrating African 
            culture and cuisine, and to make it more inviting to a wider audience.

            Our logo combines “Jóia” and “Africa” through a shared "A" to create a compact, 
            cohesive design with strong, legible characters that fit seamlessly across various culinary applications. 
            The distinct "A" with its handcrafted look and crown-like accents, symbolizes the restaurant's 
            “jewel-like” essence. Our icon features a simple outline of an African symbol representing “knowledge”,
             capturing the cultural depth and rich gastronomic value of the brand. The color palette—a 
             vibrant mix of orange, black, red, yellow, brown, and green—honors the warmth and spirit of Africa, 
             drawing from its iconic patterns and national hues to create a welcoming, joyful atmosphere for our guests.
